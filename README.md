As the project idea for this class, I decided to analyze Twitter activity of the 2018 United States Senate election in Missouri: McCaskill vs Hawley.

The initial outline of the project was as follows:

1. Learn how to pull out data from Twitter API;
2. Learn how to clean raw data using Unix Tools;
3. Get working knowledge of data science tools in Python;
4. Get working knowledge of the graph data structure;
5. Apply Machine Learning techniques in Python to identify Twitter bots.

Brief reflection in the end:

Except point number 4 (learning basics of graph data structure), everything else was part of the project in some way or another. More detailed reflection will be in the formal paper submitted to the professor.
