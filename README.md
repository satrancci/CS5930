As the project idea for this class, I decided to analyze Twitter activity of the 2018 United States Senate election in Missouri: McCaskill vs Hawley.

The outline of the project is as follows:

1. Learn how to pull out data from Twitter API;
2. Learn how to clean raw data using Unix Tools;
3. Get working knowledge of data science tools in Python;
4. Get working knowledge of the graph data structure;
5. Apply Machine Learning techniques in Python to identify Twitter bots.
